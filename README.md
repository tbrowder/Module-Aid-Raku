# Raku::ModAuthor::Aide

A Raku module with a tool to help Raku module authors develop and
maintain public modules that are consistent in format and structure,
maintainable, and contain features the Raku community considers to be
best practices.

The initial version necessarily has mostly my views from my Raku
experiences, plus it incorporates ideas from discussions on IRC
channels #raku and #raku-dev as well as information from the docs and
the original Raku design documents.
